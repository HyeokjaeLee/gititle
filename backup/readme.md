# [Open PWA](http://pranoysarkar.github.io/OpenPWA/)

#### How to build your own?

#### ❗️❕ This includes cache busting mechnism, as pwa serves from cache so changes will not be refected untill you change the version in config.json

#### ❗️❕ On changing repository name you need to update the reposity name in 👉 "service-worker.js", line no 4

This is a PWA, everything is made using webtechnologies. 🍄
